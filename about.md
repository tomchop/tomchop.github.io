Most of the times I discover new blogs, I usually like to read the 'about' page just to get an idea of what I might find before I actually go through the effort of reading one or two articles. What follows is precisely that.

What I write here will not enlighten you. It is mainly a platform on which I to expose and share different viewpoints on different matters related, I hope, to my professional ambitions (but probably more related to stuff I like).Â Maybe one or two works-in-progress, projects related to computer security, general discussion about what I can find on the NY Times, Le Monde, or other less-official-more-geek-ish sources.

Enjoy your read!
