Hi, I'm Tom! (he/him) I'm a Digital Forensics and Incident Response (a.k.a. DFIR)
engineer pinging from Zurich, Switzerland. I've been working in _the cyberz_ for
over a decade.

Most of my work is tied to digital forensics investigations and designing
platforms that help with incident response, digital forensics, threat
intelligence, and malware analysis. I'm an open-source enthusiast and I
contribute to [several projects]({{< ref "projects" >}}), both professionally
and on my free time.

I enjoy solving mysteries, answering questions, building systems that talk to
each other, and trying to understand my adversaries.
