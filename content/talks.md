## MINET - 2015 - Paris - La threat intelligence à la rescousse de la réponse à incidents

## Hack.lu - 2016 - Luxembourg - Malware analysis made easy with Volatility plugins - WORKSHOP

Volatility is a very well known, used, and loved memory forensics framework in
the DFIR community. It’s usage has been largely documented and illustrated with
different use-cases. But one aspect of Volatility that may remain a bit obscure
to analysts with even solid experience with memory forensics is the creation of
Volatility plugins to automate specific tasks.

This workshop is meant to make malware and DFIR analysts familiar with
Volatility’s plugin framework. The goal is to cover Volatility and live-memory
analysis basics and have every attendee leaving with an operational
understanding of the different plugin strategies and implementations. To
illustrate the plugin creation process, the workshop will be articulated around
the analysis of an instance of the Locky ransomware.
